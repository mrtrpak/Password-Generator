## Description

I have created a password generator that will create a password based on the user input. I first ask the user how many characters they want in it between 8-128 characters. then I ask if they want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and or special characters in it. In it I make sure that they choose at least one option so it can run properly. Once they generate the password they can hit the copy button to save it to the clipboard.

## Application

Whether you need a new password for one of the many monthly subscriptions that are out there these days, need to update current passwords, or just want a truly unique password this will create a unique password tailored to what you want in it. With this being a random password generator it makes your password more secure and can be a valuable tool to have.
